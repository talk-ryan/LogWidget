# LogWidget
This is a logging widet developed using KIVY.  After it is configured it should take files from a target server and store them in a zipped file in your c drive or specified location.  Must have access to the target server. Run UI.py to see the widget. Tested only on Windows machines. Work in progress
Not yet completed.  
Issues in the Master branch:  
Check boxes need to be hooked up to actually determine which logs to obtain.  
I automatically add a date time stamp to the log file names.  This was a specific use case and needs to be configurable.
Need to refactor UI to use KIVY language.
